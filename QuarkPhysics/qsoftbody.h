/** @brief QSoftBody is a body type that defines deformable, soft objects in the physics world. Mass-spring model is used for simulation dynamics in soft bodies. In the mass-spring model, there are particles with mass that can move individually and interact with the physics world, and these particles can be connected to each other with spring constraints. Additionally, with some user-configurable options specific to the simulation, particles can be subjected to constraints obtained from some calculations. For example, you can add a constraint that ensures particles remain faithful to their initially defined local positions using the "shape matching" option. You can apply a constraint that gives the feeling that the polygon are filled with gas and maintains their area using the "area preserving" option. You can use options that allow particles to collide with each other with a specific radius, and create objects called PBD (Position Based Dynamics). QSoftBody objects inherently require a more flexible configuration than other body types and contain many options.
